# weatherappProject
This project is based on a YouTube tutorial . I used it to learn and added/modded code to understand how weather APIs work.
##  What I Learned

- How to fetch data from a public API (OpenWeather)
- DOM manipulation using JavaScript
- Handling form input and submit events
- Using async/await for API calls
- Debugging and resolving errors in real projects
